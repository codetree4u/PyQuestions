"""
Find the majority element from the given list of size n.

The majority element in a list is the element that appears more than n/2 times.

For example,

numbers = [1, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7]
Here, 7 is the majority element in the given list. It's because 7 has occurred 4 times, which is greater than 6 / 2, which is 3.

Assumption: We will assume that the list is non-empty and the majority element is always present in the list.
